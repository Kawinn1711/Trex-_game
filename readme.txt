* Easy to use Keyboard(WASD) to XInput(XBox 360 controller) conversion software
* Have analog movement in games with your normal keyboard!
*
*
* Release notes 1.0.3:
* Added ability to change the Alt+0, but it is still confined to using the Alt key + another key. Change this in the .ini file "hotkey = 0x30" 0x30 = 0, 0x31 = 1 using Microsofts virtual key codes: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes
* Added the ability to independently alter the "diagonal" momentum based on whether +forward or +backwards was applied. Previously direction applied with +forward and +backwards used the same value.
* process priority has been set to "above normal"
*
*
* Release notes 1.0.2:
* Upped the windows priority for the process because we want keystrokes to be processed immediately, always.
* Interaction with an already running old version has been improved to make sure the latest version loads.
* Added an SOCD option in the .ini file: 0=SIP and 1=Neutral (SIP is default) // to learn more see https://www.hitboxarcade.com/blogs/cross-up/what-is-an-socd
*
* 
* Setup:
*   - Download and install(if you haven't installed this already): https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases
*       this will add a virtual device to your computer that allows us to emulate a XBox 360 controller.
*   - Start Keys2XInput from any folder
*
*   + If "block keys" is disabled, then your game may interpret a different input than the intended joystick input, this is because your game could be combining both joystick and keyboard inputs together
*   + A Global Hotkey ALT+'0' has been requested to Windows for the enable/disable functionality
*   + To use non-printable characters, for ex.: the arrow keys, you need to specify the hexadecimal representation for those keys in the .ini file
*     here is a link where you can get the value for each key: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes
*			Common non-printable characters:
*			Lshift: 			0xA0
*			Lctrl:				0xA2
*			CAPSLOCK:			0x14
*			Tab:				0x09
*			Alt (Left Menu):		0xA4
*
* Games:
*    - Fortnite: change Fortnite's settings: "Lock input method as mouse" to 'on'
